    <h1>🔒 Phishing Attack Using Hidden Eye 🕵️‍♂️</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> <br>
        This project explores the use of the Hidden Eye tool in ethical hacking to simulate phishing attacks. It helps security professionals understand how phishing tactics work and how to prevent them. 🛡️
    </p>
    <h2>🛠️ Tools & Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hidden Eye 👁️</li>
        <li>Linux 🐧</li>
        <li>ngrok 🌐</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>🚀 Steps to Implement</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>🔗 Search for Hidden Eye on GitHub and copy the clone link.</li>
        <li>💻 Use <code>git clone</code> to install Hidden Eye on Linux, then change the directory to the HiddenEye folder.</li>
        <li>📂 Run the <code>./HiddenEye.py</code> command to access HiddenEye.</li>
        <li>🖼️ Select an Attack Vector template.</li>
        <li>📲 Choose the operation type.</li>
        <li>🌐 Input the redirecting URL of the page.</li>
        <li>🔢 Select the port number and server.</li>
        <li>🔗 Share the localhost URL (e.g., <code>http://127.0.0.1:7895</code>) with the target.</li>
        <li>👤 The victim enters their details, which are displayed on the hacker's interface.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>📊 Results</h2>
    <p>The collected information is displayed on the command line, allowing ethical hackers to understand how data could be harvested through phishing and develop better countermeasures. 💻🔍</p>
    <h2>🔚 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Phishing simulations like this one are vital for raising awareness and improving defenses against social engineering attacks. Always use such techniques ethically and ensure that security practices are in place to protect user information. 🛡️👥
